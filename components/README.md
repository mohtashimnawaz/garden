Components:

- `GardenScene.tsx` - R3F Canvas that lays out multiple plants in a row and provides lights.
- `PlantRenderer.tsx` - Given a `dna` object, it builds/consumes a geometry and renders a mesh with a simple animation.

Use `app/garden/preview/page.tsx` to interactively tweak seed/iterations/angle and preview generated plants.
